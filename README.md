# Mini Cinema - Ticket System

A complete command-line experience for purchasing movie tickets, developed in Java using object-oriented programming principles.

This project started as an exercise for a bootcamp I'm currently taking. As I progressed, I expanded and structured it to simulate a complete flow of buying cinema tickets.

## What I Learned

- Object-Oriented Programming: encapsulation, class relationships, and modular code
- How to model real-world scenarios (like a cinema ticketing system) in code
- Exception handling (`try-catch`) to deal with invalid inputs
- Organizing a Java project with multiple classes for clarity and reusability

## Features

- Movie and language selection
- model.Ticket types: **Full price, Half price and Promotional**
- Order confirmation
- Refund functionality
- Input validation and exception handling
- All operations performed directly in the terminal (CLI)

## How to run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JooJHenrique/mini-cinema-java.git

   cd mini-cinema-java
   ```
2. Compile and run:
    ```base
    javac src/*.java

    java src.main.Main
    ```
## Technologies Used

- JDK 21
- Command-line interface (CLI)
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- Basic exception handling with `try-catch`
